== Introduction

Content Security Policy is delivered via a HTTP response header, much like HSTS, and defines approved sources of content that the browser may load.

A CSP header allows you to define approved sources for content on your site that the browser can load.

By specifying only those sources that you wish the browser to load content from, you can protect your visitors from a whole range of issues.

Here is a basic CSP response header:-

`Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'`

The `script-src` directive specifies the whitelist of sources that the browser may load scripts from.

`self` is a keyword which specifies the current domain.

So the browser will only load script files from the current domain.

There are other directives and keywords that can be used.

These headers only apply to responses that return one of the following content-types:

* `text/html`
* `text/javascript`
* `application/javascript` 

== Security Headers

Content Security Policy headers are added using the `SecurityHeaderMiddleWare` class.

. `AddFrameOptionsDeny` 
** Adds `X-Frame-Options: Deny` header to the response. 
** The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.

. `AddXssProtectionBlock` 
** Adds `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` header to the response.
** Enables XSS protections and instructs the user-agent to block the response in the event that script has been inserted from user input, instead of sanitizing.

. `AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff` 
** Adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to the response. 
** Disables content sniffing. 
** Can be set to protect against MIME type confusion attacks.

. `AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAge` 
** Adds `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` header to the response. 
** Tells the user-agent to cache the domain in the STS list for the number of seconds provided.

. `AddReferrerPolicyOriginWhenCrossOrigin`
** Adds `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` header to the response.
** The browser will send the full URL to requests to the same origin but only send the origin when requests are cross-origin.

. `RemoveServerHeader`
** Removes the Server header from all responses.

builder.AddDefaultSrc().Self();
----
** `AddDefaultSrc` - The `default-src` directive serves as a fallback for the other CSP fetch directives.
** Self - Allow sources from the origin from which the protected document is being served, including the same URL scheme and port number.

builder.AddConnectSrc().Self().From(stsUrl).From(socketUrl);
----
** `AddConnectSrc` - The `connect-src` directive restricts the URLs which can be loaded using script interfaces The APIs that are restricted are: `<a>`, `ping`, `Fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, and `EventSource`.
** `Self` - Allow sources from the origin from which the protected document is being served, including the same URL scheme and port number.
** `From` - Allow resources from the given uri. May be any non-empty value. In this case, we add the host url and the sts url to the list.

builder.AddUpgradeInsecureRequests();
----
** The `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive instructs user agents to treat all of a siteâ€™s insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS).
