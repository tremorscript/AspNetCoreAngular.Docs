A pull request (PR) is a way to notify a task is finished and ready to be merged into the main working branch (source of truth).

This is a guideline that the devs must follow when working with Pull Requests(PRs). 

== Pull Request Best Practices

* Keep the PR small
** They are easier to review.
** They are easier to deploy.
** Minimizes possible conflicts and stale PRs.
* Do not break the build.
* Include related tests as part of the PR.

== Pull Request Template

The project has a https://github.com/tremorscript/AspNetCoreAngular/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md[pull request template^] that is automatically added when you create a pull request.

* It should include Issue number and the link (In Github, typing `#IssueId` creates a link to the issue Id.)
* Description
** Should include a concise description of the changes (bug or feature), it’s impact, along with a summary of the solution.
* Steps to Reproduce Bug and Validate Solution
** Only applicable if the work is to address a bug.
** Provide details on the environment the bug is found, and detailed steps to recreate the bug.
** This should be detailed enough for a team member to confirm that the bug no longer occurs.
* PR Checklist
** Use the check-list below to ensure your branch is ready for PR. If the item is not applicable, leave it blank.
*** [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.
*** [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes
*** [ ] All new and existing tests passed.
*** [ ] My code follows the code style of this project.
*** [ ] I ran the lint checks which produced no new errors nor warnings for my changes.
*** [ ] I have checked to ensure there aren’t other open Pull Requests for the same update/change.
* Does this introduce a breaking change?
** [ ] Yes
** [ ] No
** If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below.
* Testing
** Instructions for testing and validation of your code:
*** What OS was used for testing.
*** Which test sets were used.
*** Description of test scenarios that you have tried
* Any relevant logs or outputs
** Use this section to attach pictures that demonstrates your changes working / healthy
** If you are printing something show a screenshot
* Other information or known dependencies
** Any other information or known dependencies that is important to this PR.
** TODO that are to be done after this PR.

== Add aliases to the config file in .git

* Add the aliases from the `.gitconfig` file of the repository to your local `.git/config` file.
* These aliases make working with `git` a bit easier.
** `git publish-branch` - Pushes the local branch updates to the current branch at origin. Rejects if the local branch is not up to date with the latest from origin.
** `git sync-from-main` - Updates your local branch from `origin/main` i.e. Github. It performs a rebase, replaying your commits on top of the tip of main or master.
** `git update-branch` - Updates your local branch with the latest from the same branch at origin. This fetches `origin/your-branch` and performs a rebase.
** `git squash-commits` - Shrinks the many commits in a branch to one commit. Useful just before merging.
** `git pr` - Opens the PR at github.com. Useful to see review comments, create a PR, or view a diff in Github.
** `git hub` - Opens the repository at github.com.
** `git amend` - Alias for `git commit --amend`
** `git ammend` - In case you are prone to misspelling `amend`

== Steps to follow while creating a Pull Request(PR)

* Checkout the main branch : `git checkout main`.
* Create a new git branch: `git checkout -b IssueNumber_description-text main`.
* Make a single commit - or an empty commit using `git commit -m "my message" --allow-empty`.
* Create a Pull request with a `WIP` in the title.
* Ensure PR is linked to Work Item.

=== Steps before Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

* Run the full test suite and ensure that all the tests pass.
* If you have multiple commits, squash your commits to one commit. Use `git squash-commits`.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows the xref:#_commit_message_guidelines[commit message guidelines].
** `git commit -a` => `-a` will automatically `add` and `rm` edited files.
* Push your branch to GitHub: `git publish-branch`.
* Send a pull request to `main`.
** If changes are suggested then:
*** Make the required updates.
*** Re-run the tests to ensure all the tests are still passing.
*** Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update the Pull Request):
**** `git rebase main -i && git push -f`

== Steps after merging a Pull Request (PR)

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and
pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows: `git push origin --delete my-fix-branch`.
* Check out the main branch: `git checkout main -f`.
* Delete the local branch: `git branch -D my-fix-branch`.
* Update your local main branch with the latest: `git update-branch`.

== Commit Message Guidelines

The repository is setup to use https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint[commitlint^] as a pre-commit hook and follows the https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional/README.md[conventional-changelog rules^] for commit messages.

....
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
....

* *fix:* a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with http://semver.org/#summary[`PATCH`] in semantic versioning).
* *feat:* a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with http://semver.org/#summary[`MINOR`] in semantic versioning).
* Sample types used by angular - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type[Angular types^]
* *BREAKING CHANGE:* a commit that has the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` at the beginning of its optional body or footer section introduces a breaking API change (correlating with 
http://semver.org/#summary[`MAJOR`] in semantic versioning). A breaking change can be part of commits of any _type_. e.g., a `fix:`, `feat:` &
`chore:` types would all be valid, in addition to any other _type_.
* Commit _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed.
* Common types according to https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum[commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)^] can be:
** build
** chore
** ci
** docs
** feat
** fix
** perf
** refactor
** revert
** style
** test
* A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`. 
* Sample scopes used by angular: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#scope[Angular Scopes^].
