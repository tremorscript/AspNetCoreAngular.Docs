== Style Guides

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions[C# Coding Guidelines^]
* https://angular.io/guide/styleguide[Angular Coding Guidelines^]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/secure-coding-guidelines[Secure Coding Guidelines^]

=== Code Formatting

The `.editorconfig` file is where the code formatting options are defined.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview#code-style-analysis[Codestyle analyzers^] use this file to analyze and fix the code.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/code-style-rule-options#example-editorconfig-file[An example editorconfig file.^]

The https://github.com/tremorscript/AspNetCoreAngular/blob/main/.editorconfig[.editorconfig^] file used by the project.

The https://github.com/dotnet/format[`dotnet format`] tool helps format all the code in a solution or a project.

The tool reads the preferences from the `.editorconfig` file.

Example Usage 1: +
`dotnet format analyzers .\AspNetCoreAngular.sln -v detailed` +
- executes third party analyzers and fixes the analyzer issues.

Example Usage 2: +
`dotnet format style .\AspNetCoreAngular.sln -v detailed` +
- executes the code style analyzers and fixes code style issues.

Example Usage 3: +
`dotnet format whitespace .\AspNetCoreAngular.sln -v detailed` +
- executes the code style analyzers and fixes whitespace.

Example Usage 4: +
`dotnet format .\AspNetCoreAngular.sln -v detailed` +
- runs all the previous 3 options.

=== Linters and Analyzers

The project uses https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers[StyleCop Analyzers^] and https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers[RoslynAnalyzers^] to analyze the code for style, quality, and maintainability, design and other issues.

The https://github.com/tremorscript/AspNetCoreAngular/blob/main/common.props[common.props^] file is where the analyzers are defined:-

....
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
    <RunCodeAnalysis>true</RunCodeAnalysis>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>false</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
    <CodeAnalysisRuleSet>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)StyleCop.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
      <AdditionalFiles Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)stylecop.json" />
      <AdditionalFiles Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory).editorconfig" />
  </ItemGroup> 
  <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers" />
    <PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
....

The `csproj` files are where you can reference this to ensure a consistent setup.

....
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <Import Project="..\common.props" />
</Project>
....

The angular app uses https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint[angular-eslint^] for linting the typescript and html code.

=== Code Review Checklist

==== General Code Review Checklist

* Focus on:
** Correctness of the business logic
** Correctness of the tests.
** Readability and maintainability of the code
** Readability and maintainability of the overall design decisions.
* [ ] Read every line changed.
* [ ] Run the PR if it aids in your understanding of the code.
* [ ] Does the PR description make sense?
* [ ] Do all the changes logically fit in this PR? or are there unrelated changes?
* [ ] If necessary, are the changes reflected in the documentation?
* [ ] Ensure UI changes look good and works as expected.
* [ ] Do the interactions of the various pieces of code in the PR make sense?
* [ ] Does the code recognize and incorporate architecture and coding patterns?
* [ ] Are functions too complex?
* [ ] Is the single responsibility principle followed? Function or class should do one thing?
* [ ] Should a function be broken into multiple functions?
* [ ] If a method has greater than 3 arguments, is it potentially overly complex?
* [ ] Does the code add functionality that isn’t needed?
* [ ] Can the code be easily understood by code readers?
* [ ] Do the function names, variable names make sense?
* [ ] Are errors handled gracefully an explicitly where necessary?
* [ ] Is there parallel programming in this PR that could cause race conditions? Carefully read through this logic.
* [ ] Could the code be optimized? For example: are there more calls to the database than need be?
* [ ] How does the functionality fit in the bigger picture? Can it have negative effects to the overall system?
* [ ] Are there security flaws?
* [ ] Does a variable name reveal any customer specific information?
* [ ] Is PII and EUII treated correctly? Are we logging any PII information?
* [ ] Are there extraneous comments? If the code isn’t clear enough to explain itself, then the code should be made simpler. Comments may be there to explain why some code exists.
* [ ] Tests should always be committed in the same PR as the code itself (`I’ll add tests next' is not acceptable).
* [ ] Make sure tests are sensible and valid assumptions are made.
* [ ] Make sure edge cases are handled as well.
* [ ] Tests can be a great source to understand the changes. It can be astrategy to look at tests first to help you understand the changes better.

==== C# Code Review Checklist

* [ ] Are internal vs private vs public classes and methods used the right way?
* [ ] Are auto property set and get used the right way? In a model without constructor and for deserialization, it is ok to have all accessible. For other classes usually a private set or internal set is better.
* [ ] Is dependency injection (DI) used? Is it setup correctly?
* [ ] Are https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x[middleware^] included in this project configured correctly?
* [ ] Is the code creating a lot of short-lived objects. Could we optimize GC pressure?
* [ ] Is the code written in a way that causes boxing operations to happen?
* [ ] Does the code https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/best-practices-for-exceptions[handle exceptions correctly^]?
* [ ] Is proper exception handling set up? Catching the exception base class (`catch (Exception)`) is generally not the right pattern. Instead, catch the specific exceptions that can happen e.g., `IOException`
* [ ] Are resources released deterministically using the IDispose pattern? Are all disposable objects properly disposed (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement[using pattern^])?
* [ ] Is the `using` pattern for streams and other disposable classes used? If not, better to have the `Dispose` method called explicitly.
* [ ] Does this code properly validate arguments sanity(i.e. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1062[CA1062^])?Consider leveraging extensions such as https://github.com/danielwertheim/Ensure.That[Ensure.That^]
* [ ] Instead of using raw strings, are constants used in the main class? Or if these strings are used across files/classes, is there a static class for the constants?
* [ ] Are magic numbers explained? There should be no number in the code without at least a comment of why this is here. If the number is repetitive, is there a constant/enum or equivalent?
* [ ] Does this code make correct use of asynchronous programming constructs, including proper use of await and Task.WhenAll including CancellationTokens? 
* [ ] If a method is asynchronous, is `Task.Delay` used instead of `Thread.Sleep`? `Task.Delay` is not blocking the current thread and creates a task that will complete without blocking the thread, so in a multi-threaded, multi-task environment, this is the one to prefer.
* [ ] Is a cancellation token for asynchronous tasks needed rather than bool patterns?
* [ ] Is the code subject to concurrency issues? Are shared objects properly protected?
* [ ] Are the classes that maintain collections in memory, thread safe? When used under concurrency, use lock pattern.
* [ ] Are tests arranged correctly with the *Arrange/Act/Assert* pattern and properly documented in this way?
* [ ] Are pure functions used as much as possible?Look for impure functions. Functions mutating arguments. Preferably try to make as many classes in the domain layer static with static methods.
* [ ] Select method or any Linq function should only be used with pure functions.
* [ ] Unit tests - check if datetimes are properly tested. Make sure stubs are used in place of objects that perform I/O or side effects like Datetime.UtcNow or DbConnections.
* [ ] Async all the way up. ConfigureAwait(false) all the way down.
* [ ] Does this code include  (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview[telemetry, metrics and tracing^] and https://serilog.net/[logging^]) instrumentation?
* [ ] Is a minimum level of logging in place? Are the logging levels used sensibly?
* [ ] Does this code leverage the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-3.1[options design pattern^] by using classes to provide strongly typed access to groups of related settings?
* [ ] Is the use of #pragma fair?
* [ ] Is package management being used (NuGet) instead of committing DLLs?

==== Typescript Code Review Checklist

* [ ] No warnings or errors after running prettier and ESLint.
* [ ] Is `use strict;` used to reduce errors with undeclared variables.
* [ ] Does the change re-implement code better served by pulling in an existing module.
* [ ] Are unit tests used when possible?
* [ ] Are tests arranged correctly with the _Arrange/Act/Assert_ pattern.
* [ ] Are best practices for error handling followed, as well as `try catch finally` statements.
* [ ] Are the `doWork().then(doSomething).then(checkSomething)` properly followed for async calls, including `expect`, `done`?
* [ ] Instead of using raw strings, are constants used in the main class? Or if these strings are used across files/classes, is there a static class for the constants?
* [ ] Are magic numbers explained? There should be no number in the code without at least a comment of why it is there. If the number is repetitive, is there a constant/enum or equivalent?
* [ ] If there is an asynchronous method, does the name of the method end with the `Async` suffix?
* [ ] Is a minimum level of logging in place? Are the logging levels used sensibly?
* [ ] Are heavy operations implemented in the backend, leaving the controller as thin as possible?
* [ ] Is event handling on the html efficiently done?
* [ ] Are promises correctly converted to observables?
* [ ] Are observables correctly subscribed and unsubscribed in components.

=== Code Inspections

Occasionally, maybe before a release, perform a http://www.ganssle.com/inspections.pdf[Code Inspections^] activity over the solution.
